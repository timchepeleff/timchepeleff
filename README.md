## Hey, I'm Tim. ðŸ‘‹ 

I solve problems with technology. 


## About me



Iâ€™m a multi-disciplined Software, Platform, and Reliabty engineer with experience spanning various client, server and cloud technologies. 

At the moment I'm working as a Staff Release Engineer [@Wayfair](https://tech.wayfair.com/) where I'm promoting sane (and opinionated) deployment patterns that are used by well over 1000 different services. Previously, I was consulting with early stage startups [@BarbershopLabs](http://barbershoplabs.com/) where I was quickly delivering POCs and MVPs to market. 

Lately, I've been working extensively with the following: 


* Node.js & Python
* Container technologies (e.g. Docker/Kubernetes)
* GCP (GKE, GCF, GCE, CloudSQL, and more)
* Microservice Architectures
* Monorepo Architectures
* Event Driven Architectures
