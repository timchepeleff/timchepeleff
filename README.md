### Hey, I'm Tim. ðŸ‘‹

I solve problems with technology. I'm currently working as a Staff Release Engineer over [@Wayfair](https://tech.wayfair.com/) and pushing simple, opinionated patterns. Previously, I was consulting with early stage startups [@BarbershopLabs](http://barbershoplabs.com/) and delivering POCs and MVPs to market. Fast.

## About me

Iâ€™m a multi-disciplined Software, Platform, and Reliabty engineer with experience spanning various client, server and cloud technologies. 

Lately, I've been working extensively with the following: 

* Node.js & Python
* Container technology (e.g. Docker/Kubernetes)
* GCP (GKE, GCF, GCE, CloudSQL, and more)
* Microservice Architectures
* Serverless Architectures
