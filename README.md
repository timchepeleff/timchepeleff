## Hey, I'm Tim. 👋 

I solve problems with technology. 


## About me

I’m a multi-disciplined Software, Platform, and Reliability engineer with experience spanning various client, server and cloud technologies. 

Currently I'm working as a Senior Infrastructure Engineer at Chime. Before Chime, I was a Staff Release Engineer [@Wayfair](https://tech.wayfair.com/) where I introduced and led the rollout of continuous deployment to over 1000 different services. _Before that_, I was doing full stack consulting with early stage startups [@BarbershopLabs](http://barbershoplabs.com/) where I was quickly delivering POCs and MVPs to market, which was a ton of fun. I'm a full stack dev at heart.
