### Hey, I'm Tim. ðŸ‘‹ 

I solve problems with technology. 


#### About me

Iâ€™m a multi-disciplined software engineer with experience spanning various client, server and cloud technologies. 

Lately I've been working as a Infrastructure Engineer at [Chime](https://www.chime.com/). Think AWS, Kubernetes, Platform/Release engineering.  

Before Chime, I was a Staff Engineer [@Wayfair](https://tech.wayfair.com/) where I introduced continuous deployment to over 1000 different services. _Before that_, I was a full stack dev, primarily working with early stage startups [@BarbershopLabs](http://barbershoplabs.com/) where we quickly delivered POCs and MVPs so our customers could raise additional money, or increase their revenue to the point where they could hire in house.  

Full stack dev at heart.
