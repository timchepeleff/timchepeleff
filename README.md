## Hey, I'm Tim. ðŸ‘‹ 

I solve problems with technology. 


## About me

Iâ€™m a multi-disciplined software engineer with experience spanning various client, server and cloud technologies. 

Lately I've been working as a Senior Infrastructure Engineer at Chime. Think AWS, Kubernetes, Release/Platform engineering.  

Before Chime, I was a Staff Release Engineer [@Wayfair](https://tech.wayfair.com/) where I introduced continuous deployment to over 1000 different services. _Before that_, I was a full stack dev, primarily workign with early stage startups [@BarbershopLabs](http://barbershoplabs.com/) where I was quickly delivering POCs and MVPs to market. 


I'm a full stack dev at heart.
