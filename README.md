### Hey, I'm Tim. ðŸ‘‹ <img alt="Tim Chepeleff"  align="right" src="https://github.com/timchepeleff/timchepeleff/blob/master/5407406.jpeg" width="144">



I solve problems with technology. 

At the moment I'm working as a Staff Release Engineer over [@Wayfair](https://tech.wayfair.com/) where I'm promoting simple, opinionated deployment patterns which are used by > 1000 different services.  Previously, I was consulting with early stage startups [@BarbershopLabs](http://barbershoplabs.com/) where I was agressively delivering POCs and MVPs to market. 

## About me

Iâ€™m a multi-disciplined Software, Platform, and Reliabty engineer with experience spanning various client, server and cloud technologies. 

Lately, I've been working extensively with the following: 

* Node.js & Python
* Container technologies (e.g. Docker/Kubernetes)
* GCP (GKE, GCF, GCE, CloudSQL, and more)
* Microservice Architectures
* Monorepo Architectures
* Event Driven Architectures
